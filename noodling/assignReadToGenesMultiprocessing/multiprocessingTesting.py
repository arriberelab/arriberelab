Messing around with multiprocessing for use in assignReadsToGenesX.py script(s)

Major test will be to compare the speeds of writing a bunch of csv lines to a file with:
    1. Multiprocessing, with each process writing to the csv on its own
    2. Multiprocessing, with each process writing to a list/dict/df, then that being writen to csv all at once
    3. Vectorizing (word? not sure), having the process act on the entire df to try and take advantage of the
        faster C backend of vectorized methods

Main plan will be to implement a toy method for each of the above then run it at a very high repitition
