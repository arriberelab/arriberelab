# Welcome To Marcus Viscardi's Mess
A directory full of half-baked scripts and programing ideas

##Table of Contents:

1\. *assignReadsToGenesMultiprocessing*
> Trying various forms of [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/multiprocessing.html) in an effort to 
speed up read assignment

> Another option of using [Pandarallel](https://github.com/nalepae/pandarallel) could be cool, although current
**(April 9, 2020)** tests make vectorized processing (utilizing *pandas.apply()*) look faster that both
[Pandarallel](https://github.com/nalepae/pandarallel) and
[Muliprocessing.pool.Pool()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#module-multiprocessing.pool)

2\. *multiIndexingDataframes*
> Attempt at using [multiIndexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/advanced.html) with 
[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) dataframes to see if they'll be faster/lighter/easier-to-process

3\. *otherNoodling*
> Pretty much just random stuff that does not fit in elsewhere
